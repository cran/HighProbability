If you have trouble installing this R package, try this instead:
1. Use setwd('HighProbability/R') to set the working directory to the directory with "HighProbability.s". You may have to use a different argument for setwd(), depending on your current directory and operating system.
2. Use source('HighProbability.s').
3. See the man directory and davidbickel.com for documentation.
Your session would look simimar to this:
> setwd('HighProbability/R')
> source('HighProbability.s')

If you will HighProbability regularly, it may be worth the effort to install the entire package. See the R documentation for UNIX, or install the package through the pull-down menus of R for Windows or RAqua for Mac OS X. Once it is installed, use this command:
> library(HighProbability)
